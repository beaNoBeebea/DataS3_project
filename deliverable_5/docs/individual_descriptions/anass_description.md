- The StaffWorkloadThirty view provides a statistical summary of appointments for every staff member, breaking down totals into 'Scheduled', 'Cancelled', and 'Completed' counts. It ensures comprehensive reporting by including staff with no current activity and automatically converting any NULL values into zeros for accurate analysis.
- The check_stock_ins & check_stock_upd triggers safeguard the Stock table by validating data before any insert or update occurs. They automatically block transactions and raise errors if a user attempts to save negative quantities, negative reorder levels, or non-positive unit prices, ensuring only valid inventory data enters the system.
